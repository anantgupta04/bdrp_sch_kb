The sandstones are usually micaceous and glauconitic and sometimes contain small amounts of pyrite. The sandstones in the type well are carbonate- and silica-cemented in zones. In the reference well, the upper part of the formation consists of medium- and coarse-grained to pebbly sandstones and conglomerates alternating with dark grey claystones. The conglomerates are both matrix- and grain-supported. The claystones are often found as 0.5-5 m thick layers between the sandstones. They are dark grey, usually calcareous and contain varying amounts of siltstone. They may occasionally pass into light grey, micaceous, calcareous and glauconitic siltstones." ;

    ns1:has_lithology "The lowermost five metres of the Blærerot Formation consist of intensely bioturbated grey to yellowish brown limestone and sandy dolomites in core 7029/03-U-01. Bugge et al. (1995) described these as partially dolomitised mudstones and wackestones containing gastropods, brachiopods, bivalves, trilobites, foraminifers and crinoids. Large, laminated irregular nodules, interpreted as oncoids, are present in the lower part. The carbonates are overlain by a 23 m thick coarsening-upward succession of dark grey silty shale with a total organic carbon (TOC) content of 3-4% in the lower part. The shale becomes more bioturbated and less organic-rich upwards. It contains much of the same marine fossils as in the underlying carbonate unit, but in addition abundant terrestrial plant remains are present. There is sharp transition towards the overlying 22 m thick sandstone dominated unit, which consists of two coarsening-upwards cycles with basal dark grey siltstones. The sandstones are fine- to medium-grained and contain low-angle trough cross lamination and wave ripples (Fig 9.17). Yellowish-brown silty shales with some coal abruptly overlie the apparently shallow marine succession of the lower Blærerot Formation and these are interpreted as coastal plain deposits (Fig 9.18). Log correlation suggests that the same overall lithologies are present in the reference well 7128/6-1. Cuttings from the basal carbonate bed in this well include a fauna very similar to that described from the type section." ;

Trough cross-bedding and horizontal lamination is common. This lower development is overlain by a 125 m thick unit of rhythmically interbedded shales, fossiliferous dolomitic mudstones to packstones (locally with anhydrite or chert nodules), and fine- to medium-grained sandstones with a few pebbly sandstone beds. Crinoids, brachiopods, fusulinids, small foraminifers and corals are the most abundant fossils, together with occasional phylloid algae and palaeoaplysinid plates.

The wackestones also display Stromatactis-like cavities, which form a complex interconnected pore system. The cavities are often partly supported by fenestrate bryozoans and brachiopods, and are often filled by geopetal internal sediments with a grainstone or packstone fabric. The geopetal fabrics indicate that deposition occurred on primary slopes of up to 45o (Blendinger et al. 1997).

The epiclastics, ranging from agglomerate to tuffs, comprise lava and phenocryst clasts, or primary pumice and ? lapilli fragments. Only minor pyroclastics have been recognised. Interbedded sediments are present towards the base of the type section, consisting of dominantly red to brown mudstone, which is soft to firm and locally calcareous. Minor amounts of red-brown or grey-green siltstone and fine grained, friable, brown sandstone are present. Lateral lithological and petrographical variations have been described by Howitt and others (1975)." ;

This basal part of the section is often difficult to recognise away from the type well and is locally absent. Above 2905 m in the type well the formation consists of approximately equal amounts of sandstone and silty shale. These sandstones are fine to medium grained and poor to moderately sorted with subangular grains. They are generally micaceous and have a kaolinitic matrix. The silty shales are grey and light green or occasionally red-brown in colour, and micromicaceous. Carbonaceous debris, sometimes in thin laminae, is present but distinct lignite beds are absent. Away from the type well the sandstone percentage in the upper part of the formation may vary from about 15 to about 75. In the area of the Brent and Statfjord fields the average sandstone bed thickness is about 2.5 m and shale beds average about 4 m in thickness.

The carbonates contain a warm-water biota dominated by small foraminifers, fusulinids and calcareous algae and with abundant fragments of Palaeoaplysina (Fig 9.36a , 9.36b , 9.36c , 9.37). Crinoids, bryozoans, brachiopods and corals are also present. Siliciclastics are rare in the Ørn Formation and the vast bulk of its rhythmic development is characterised by pure carbonates, or more distally, carbonates and evaporites - in contrast to the mixed siliciclastics and carbonates of the underlying Falk Formation. A temporary return to mixed carbonates and shales near the top of the formation is characterised by a gamma ray peak on the logs. In well 7128/6-1, the lower part of the formation consists of rhythms of dolomitic mudstone and bryozoan wackestone with minor thin shales (Fig 9.30 , 9.31 , 9.36a , 9.36b , 9.36c , 9.37). This is followed by a succession of Palaeoaplysina-dominated buildups interbedded with fusulinid-dominated wackestone, overlain by an interval dominated by dolomitic mudstone with abundant anhydrite nodules. The upper part of the formation in this well consists of a thick unit dominated by foraminifer- and algal-rich packstones and grainstones overlain by cyclic deposited shales and crinoid-dominated silty wackestones that gradually pass up into foraminifer-dominated packstones and grainstones. The same spectrum of shallow marine carbonate facies is seen in cores from 7120/2-1, 7128/4-1, 7029/03-U-02, 7030/03-U-01, 7129/10-U-01 and 7129/10-U-02, suggesting a fairly uniform development on the platforms. In addition more than 5 m thick beds of massive to laminated anhydrite occur in 7029/03-U-02 and 7030/03-U-01 and native sulphur is locally present between 20 m and 35 m in 7029/03-U-02. In well 7226/11-1 the lower part of the Ørn Formation consists of light grey to medium dark brownish grey dolomitic mudstones to packstones. These are interbedded with light grey to white massive anhydrite that increases in abundance upward to 4392.5m. Above this level rhythms of dark greyish-green calcareous shale and light grey fossiliferous limestone with chert nodules dominate. This unit is equivalent to the upper part of 7128/6-1. Log correlation suggests that the development in well 7226/11-1 resembles that of other distally located wells such as 7121/1-1 R and 7124/3-1.

The offshore development has been dated to the Viséan to early Serpukhovian. On the Finnmark Platform, palynomorphs suggest that the basal part of the group is of middle to late Viséan age (Bugge et al. 1995), i.e. significantly younger than the Famennian to Tournaisian age recorded for the basal sediments onshore. The upper part of the group is apparently of late Viséan to early Serpukhovian age (Bugge et al. 1995; Simon-Robertson 1992 and Geochem Group 1994). As noted above - the succession on the Loppa High has been dated to the Viséan to early Serpukhovian (Lindström, in press)." ;
    ns1:has_lithology "On the Finnmark Platform, medium- to coarse-grained, occasionally conglomeratic, sandstones and minor siltstones and coals dominate the basal part of the succession represented by the Soldogg Formation. These are overlain by a succession of stacked metre-scale fining-upward cycles of sandstone, siltstone, claystone and coal assigned to the Tettegras Formation. The upper part of the group, represented by the Blærerot Formation, is characterised by a basal unit of fossiliferous limestones, overlain by marine shales and fine- to medium-grained, fluvial and shallow marine sandstones. Sediments tentatively assigned to the group are very differently developed on the Loppa High where well 7120/2-1 penetrated 847 m of varicoloured arkosic breccias, conglomerates, ignimbrites and other types of volcanoclastic deposits (Fig 9.10). The basal 115 m are dominated by brownish siltstone and mudstone. The red nature of these sediments, together with their high content of volcanoclastics, makes them anomalous representatives of the Billefjorden Group in this area, although palynomorphs indicate an early Carboniferous age (Viséan PU to VF Miospore zones from 3467 to 2682 m and early Serpukhovian TK Zone from 2645 to 2630 m) (Lindström, in press). The only other arctic areas where lower Carboniferous red beds have been found are in the northern part of eastern Greenland (Stemmerik et al. 1993), but even there the change to red beds appears to have occurred in the late Tournaisian – i.e. older than the earliest datings on the Loppa High. The Loppa sequence’s overall lithology and tectonic setting seems rather to suggest closer affinities to the lowermost clastics of the overlying mid-Carboniferous Gipsdalen Group. More work is clearly needed on this problem, especially in view of this representing the only occurrence of volcanoclastics in the Upper Palaeozoic of the Barents Shelf; we note that dolerite dykes of probable mid- to late Carboniferous age have been reported by Lippard & Prestvik (1997) on Magerøy in Finnmark and mid-Carboniferous volcanics have also been identified on the adjacent Kola peninsula in northern Russia (Ulmishek 1982). In view of these uncertainties, this sequence has not yet been defined as a formational unit, and its assignment to the Billefjorden Group is still tentative." .

In well 17/4-1 rocks of probable Rotliegend age include conglomerate with pebbles of quartzite, gneiss, acid volcanic rocks and mica schist in a well-cemented argillaceous and sandy matrix." .

    ns1:has_age "In the North Sea the group ranges in age from Cenomanian to Danian. The siliciclastic facies is restricted in age to the Late Cretaceous." ;
    ns1:has_lithology "The group consists of the chalk facies of chalky limestones, limestones, marls, and calcareous shales and mudstones. Chert (flint) occurs throughout the facies. The siliciclastic facies consists of mudstones and shales, partly interbedded with limestones. Minor amounts of sandstones are present in the lower part in the Agat Discovery area (block 35/3). The shales and sandstones are slightly to very calcareous. In the Maastrichtian sequence the quantity of limestones are generally higher on the Horda Platform than in the Viking Graben." .

    ns1:has_lithology "The group exhibits a transition from continental to shallow marine sediments. In the type well area it is a transitional \"coarsening upward\" sequence in the basal parts consisting of grey, green and sometimes red shale interbedded with thin siltstones, sandstones and dolomitic limestones. Above are massive white to grey sandstone bodies interbedded with greenish-grey to red-brown shales. The top part of the group consists of thick, white to grey, fossiliferous and glauconitic sandstones. On the Horda Platform, east of the Viking Graben, the group consists of massive, white, fine to coarse grained sandstones inter-bedded with light grey, and sometimes red, silty micaceous, lignitic shales. Towards the east the frequency of black, coaly shales and coal layers increases." .

Palynological data from cores 7128/12-U-01 and 7129/10-U-01 indicate a ?Kungurian to Kazanian (-?Tatarian) age for the group updip onthe Finnmark Platform (Mangerud 1994; Bugge et al. 1995). Palynomorphs from exploration wells indicate a general mid- to late Permian age for the group without permitting a more detailed internal zonation." ;
    ns1:has_lithology "The Tempelfjorden Group is characterised by dark to light grey spiculites, spiculitic cherts, silicified skeletal limestones and fine-grained siliciclastics including marls, calcareous claystones, shales and silt/sandstones in the offshore areas. In the southwestern Hammerfest Basin ( 7120/12-4 and 7120/12-2) the group contains a significant proportion of coarse siliciclastics. Elsewhere in the Norwegian Barents Sea, spiculites and silicified skeletal carbonates dominate. The carbonates contain a fauna dominated by brachiopods, sponges, bryozoans and crinoids. The condensed development of the Miseryfjellet Formation on the Stappen High contains herringbone cross-bedded sandstones and highly condensed silicified skeletal limestones." .
