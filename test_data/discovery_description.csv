1/9-1 Tommeliten Alpha,"1/9-1 Tommeliten Alpha is a discovery near the border to the UK sector in the southern part of the Norwegian sector in the North Sea, 25 kilometres southwest of the Ekofisk field. The water depth is 75 metres. The discovery was proven in 1977. The reservoir contains gas and condensate in chalk in the Paleocene Ekofisk Formation and Upper Cretaceous Tor Formation. It lies at a depth of about 3,000 metres. Four wells were drilled on the discovery, the last one in 2003. The development of Tommeliten Alpha has been stopped two times at the concept selection stage. Different alternatives for a development of the discovery are being studied, all based on a tie-back to the Ekofisk Centre."
15/12-21 (Grevling),"15/12-21 (Grevling) is a discovery in the central part of the North Sea, 15 kilometres south of the Sleipner Øst field. The water depth is 90 metres.

17/12-1 Vette,"Vette was discovered in 1972 in production licence 016. The discovery is located at a water depth of about 110 metres in the southeastern part of the Norwegian sector in the North Sea, approximately 50 kilometres northwest of the Yme field.

Appraisal well 17/12-4, including two horizontal sidetracks, was drilled in 2009. The most probable development solution is a leased production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO). Water injection combined with gas lift is recommended as drainage strategy. According to plan, excess associated gas will be exported via a new gas pipeline to the Drauper E platform.
