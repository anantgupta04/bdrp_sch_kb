EKOFISK,Development ,"Ekofisk is a field in the southern part of the Norwegian sector in the North Sea. The water depth is 70 metres. Ekofisk was discovered in 1969, and the initial plan for development and operation (PDO) was approved in 1972. Test production was initiated in 1971 and ordinary production started in 1972. Production was initially routed to tankships until a concrete storage tank was installed in 1973. Since then, the field has been further developed with many facilities, including facilities for associated fields and export pipelines. Several of the initial facilities have already been removed or are awaiting decommissioning. The initial field development started with three production platforms: Ekofisk A, Ekofisk B and Ekofisk C. Wellhead platform Ekofisk X and process platform Ekofisk J were installed in 1996 and 1998, respectively, as part of the Ekofisk II project. In 2005, wellhead platform Ekofisk M was installed as part of the Ekofisk Growth Project. A plan for water injection at Ekofisk was approved in 1983. Ekofisk K, which is the main injection facility, started water injection in 1987 and is still in operation. There had also been water injection at Ekofisk W from 1989 until 2009, when Ekofisk W was shut down and replaced by a subsea template, Ekofisk VA. A PDO for the development of Ekofisk South was approved in 2011. The project included two new installations in the southern part of the field: production platform Ekofisk Z and a subsea template for water injection, Ekofisk VB. Injection from Ekofisk VB and production from Ekofisk Z started in 2013. The accommodation facilities Ekofisk H and Ekofisk Q were replaced by Ekofisk L in 2014. An amended PDO for an additional water injection template, Ekofisk VC, was approved in 2017.",43506,25.02.2020,17.02.2021
EKOFISK,Reservoir ,"Ekofisk produces oil from naturally fractured chalk of Late Cretaceous age in the Tor Formation and early Paleocene age in the Ekofisk Formation.

EKOFISK,Recovery ,"Ekofisk was originally produced by pressure depletion and had an expected recovery factor of 17 per cent. Since then, comprehensive water injection has contributed to a substantial increase in oil recovery. Large-scale water injection started in 1987, and in subsequent years, the area for water injection has been extended in several phases. Experience has proven that water displaces the oil much more effectively than anticipated, and the expected final recovery factor for Ekofisk is now estimated to be over 50 per cent. In addition to the water injection, compaction of the soft chalk provides extra force to drainage of the field. The reservoir compaction has resulted in about 10 metres subsidence of the seabed, especially in the central part of the field. It is expected that the subsidence will continue, but at a much lower rate.",43506,16.03.2018,17.02.2021

EKOFISK,Status ,"Production from Ekofisk is maintained at a high level through continuous water injection, drilling of production and injection wells, and well interventions. Key challenges are identifying the remaining oil pockets in a mature, waterflooded reservoir, as well as handling the increasing volumes of produced water. Ekofisk Life of Field Seismic (LoFS) provides data for monitoring of waterflood and dynamic changes in the overburden for use in reservoir management. First phase drilling on Ekofisk Z was completed in 2020. Infill drilling on Ekofisk is expected to continue throughout the lifetime of the field. Water injection is extended in the southern part of the field by the installation of a new subsea template, Ekofisk VC.

The field has two main structures: Troll Øst and Troll Vest. About two-thirds of the recoverable gas reserves lie in Troll Øst. The gas and oil reservoirs in the Troll Øst and Troll Vest structures consist primarily of shallow marine sandstone of Late Jurassic age in the Sognefjord Formation. Part of the reservoir is also in the underlying Fensfjord Formation of Middle Jurassic age. The field consists of three relatively large rotated fault blocks. The eastern fault block constitutes Troll Øst. The reservoir depth at Troll Øst is 1,330 metres. Pressure communication between Troll Øst and Troll Vest has been proven. Originally, the oil column in Troll Øst was mapped to be 0-4 metres thick. A well drilled in 2007 proved an oil column of 6-9 metres in the Fensfjord Formation in the northern segment of Troll Øst. The Troll Vest oil province originally had a 22 to 26-metre-thick oil column under a small gas cap, located at a depth of 1,360 metres. The Troll Vest gas province originally had an oil column of 12-14 metres under a gas column of up to 200 metres. The oil column is now reduced to only 2 to 4 metres thickness. A significant volume of residual oil is encountered directly below the Troll Vest oil column.

The oil in Troll Vest is produced from long horizontal wells, which penetrate the thin oil zone directly above the oil-water contact. The recovery strategy is based primarily on pressure depletion, but this is accompanied by a simultaneous expansion of both the gas cap above the oil zone and the underlying water zone. Some gas is also reinjected to increase oil production. Produced water was reinjected into the northern part of the Troll Vest oil province from 2000 to 2016. ",46437,25.04.2019,17.02.2021

ÅSGARD,Development ,"Åsgard is a field in the central part of the Norwegian Sea. The water depth is 240-300 metres. Åsgard was discovered in 1981, and the plan for development and operation (PDO) was approved in 1996. The Åsgard field includes the deposits Smørbukk, Smørbukk Sør and Midgard. The field has been developed with subsea wells tied-back to a production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO), Åsgard A. The development also includes Åsgard B, a floating, semi-submersible facility for gas and condensate processing. The gas centre is connected to a storage vessel for condensate, Åsgard C. Production started in 1999 and gas export started in 2000. The Åsgard facilities are an important part of the Norwegian Sea infrastructure. The Mikkel and Morvin fields are tied to Åsgard B for processing, and gas from Åsgard B is sent to the Tyrihans field for gas lift. The PDO for a gas compression facility at Midgard was approved in 2012. The Trestakk field is tied-in to Åsgard A.",43765,26.02.2020,17.02.2021
ÅSGARD,Reservoir ,"Åsgard produces gas and considerable amounts of condensate from Jurassic sandstone at depths of as much as 4850 metres. The reservoir quality varies in the different formations, and there are large variations in the reservoir properties between the three deposits. The Smørbukk deposit is in a rotated fault block and contains gas, condensate and oil in the Åre, Tilje, Tofte, Ile and Garn Formations. The Smørbukk Sør deposit contains oil, gas and condensate in the Tilje, Ile and Garn Formations. The Midgard gas deposits are divided into four structural segments with the main reservoir in the Ile and Garn Formations.",43765,17.02.2021,17.02.2021
ÅSGARD,Recovery ,Smørbukk is produced partly by pressure depletion and partly by injection of excess gas from the field. Smørbukk Sør is produced by pressure support from gas injection. Midgard is produced by pressure depletion.,43765,11.04.2017,17.02.2021
ÅSGARD,Transport ,"Oil and condensate are temporarily stored at Åsgard A, then shipped to land by tankers. The gas is exported through the Åsgard Transport System (ÅTS) to the terminal at Kårstø. The condensate from Åsgard is sold as oil.",43765,27.02.2020,17.02.2021
ÅSGARD,Status ,"Work is ongoing to increase the recovery from the field. Conversion of gas injection wells to gas production wells at Smørbukk is ongoing, and it is possible to switch between injection and production. This maintains gas injection in Smørbukk and Smørbukk Sør, and gas export volumes from the Åsgard field. Third party tie-ins to Åsgard will prolong the lifetime of the facilities.",43765,17.02.2021,17.02.2021
AASTA HANSTEEN,Development ,"Aasta Hansteen is a field in the northern part of the Norwegian Sea, 120 kilometres northwest of the Norne field. The water depth is 1,270 metres. Aasta Hansteen was discovered in 1997, and the plan for development and production (PDO) was approved in 2013. The field initially comprised three separate deposits: Luva, Haklang and Snefrid Sør. A new deposit was discovered in 2015, Snefrid Nord. The field is developed with a spar platform, a floating installation with a cylindrical column moored to the seabed. The development also includes two subsea templates with four slots each and two subsea templates with one slot each (satellites). The templates are tied-back to the platform through pipelines and steel catenary risers. Aasta Hansteen was granted a PDO exemption for the development of the Snefrid Nord deposit in 2017. Production started in 2018.",23395946,26.02.2020,17.02.2021
AASTA HANSTEEN,Reservoir ,"The main reservoirs contain gas in Upper Cretaceous sandstone in the Nise Formation, at a depth of 3000 metres. The reservoir quality is good.",23395946,17.02.2021,17.02.2021
AASTA HANSTEEN,Recovery ,The field is produced by pressure depletion and natural aquifer drive. ,23395946,25.04.2019,17.02.2021
AASTA HANSTEEN,Transport ,Gas from Aasta Hansteen is transported via the Polarled pipeline to the terminal at Nyhamna. Light oil is offloaded to shuttle tankers and transported to the market.,23395946,27.02.2020,17.02.2021
AASTA HANSTEEN,Status ,Production from Snefrid Nord started in 2019. Aasta Hansteen is considered a possible host for nearby discoveries after the field goes off plateau production. The Asterix discovery is currently being matured as a tie-in development to Aasta Hansteen.,23395946,17.02.2021,17.02.2021
