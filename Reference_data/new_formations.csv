The sandstone unit now defined as the Oseberg Formation has long been considered anomalous in the sense that it does not fit well into the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù Brent Group succession as is seen, for example, in well 34/10-8. The basal unit`s (now Oseberg Formation) anomalous coarseness an homogeneity, its common, sharply defined base and ‚Äúblocky‚Äù log pattern, and the indications of a Late Toarcian/Aalenian age for its lowermost parts in some wells have always been awkward aspects of Brent Group lithostratigraphy where the sand unit was interpreted as Etive Formation or as a combined Rannoch/ Etive Formation.^The Oseberg Formation has a typical ‚Äúblocky‚Äù log motif (gamma-ray and neutron/density logs), reflecting the homogeneous nature of the sand units compared to the underlying and intercalating mudstones.

Polarrev Formation,polarrev formation,FORMATION,bjarmeland group,Norway,"The formation consists of a variety of facies that characterise carbonate buildups. The bulk of the formation consists of bryozoan- and bryozoan/Tubiphytes-dominated wackestones and cementstones with abundant early marine cement (Fig 9.44). Wackestones dominate the bioherm encountered in the type well, where a sparse assemblage of fenestrate bryozoans, brachiopods and crinoids formed a loose framework that trapped the carbonate mud. The wackestones also display Stromatactis-like cavities, which form a complex interconnected pore system. The cavities are often partly supported by fenestrate bryozoans and brachiopods, and are often filled by geopetal internal sediments with a grainstone or packstone fabric. The geopetal fabrics indicate that deposition occurred on primary slopes of up to 45o (Blendinger et al. 1997). The limestone is massive to thickly bedded, white to light grey, locally pinkish grey and light brownish grey in colour. In the lower part of the formation more thin bedded and silty limestones are locally present.

The lavas are grey or purplish, vesicular and often partially altered, and locally completely laterised. Large fresh pyroxene phenocrysts and smaller altered olivine phenocrysts are set in a groundmass of pyroxene and feldspar. Autobrecciation, late hydrothermal activity and deep weathering and oxidation are fairly common. The epiclastics, ranging from agglomerate to tuffs, comprise lava and phenocryst clasts, or primary pumice and ? lapilli fragments. Only minor pyroclastics have been recognised. Interbedded sediments are present towards the base of the type section, consisting of dominantly red to brown mudstone, which is soft to firm and locally calcareous. Minor amounts of red-brown or grey-green siltstone and fine grained, friable, brown sandstone are present. Lateral lithological and petrographical variations have been described by Howitt and others (1975). ","Present evidence indicates a Middle Jurassic age (Bajocian‚ÄìBathonian). In the southern part of the volcanic province the interbedded red-beds are barren, but sparsely fossiliferous grey beds in the north near the base and top of the formation yield Bajocian‚ÄìBathonian dates, based on floral dating and rare ostracods. Radiometric dating of whole-rock samples which are sheared, altered and often with secondary mineralization has provided a range of minimum ages from 165+/- 4 Ma (million years) to 109+/- 2 Ma. No systematic change in age has been recognized and the volcanic are assumed to be essentially the product of one synchronous episode. "

Above 2905 m in the type well the formation consists of approximately equal amounts of sandstone and silty shale. These sandstones are fine to medium grained and poor to moderately sorted with subangular grains. They are generally micaceous and have a kaolinitic matrix. The silty shales are grey and light green or occasionally red-brown in colour, and micromicaceous. Carbonaceous debris, sometimes in thin laminae, is present but distinct lignite beds are absent. Away from the type well the sandstone percentage in the upper part of the formation may vary from about 15 to about 75.

","Late Hauterivian to Late Barremian (Heilmann-Clausen 1987, Thomsen 1987). "
Ty Formation ,ty formation ,FORMATION,rogaland group,United Kingdom,"The Ty Formation consists of clean sandstones, generally massive and clear to light grey in colour. Distally the sandstones are interbedded with dark grey shales, but the sandstone bodies tend to be clean. ",Early Paleocene. 
Ugle Formation,ugle formation,FORMATION,gipsdalen group,Norway,"The formation is characterised by reddish-brown to brown conglomerates, coarse-grained sandstones and minor siltstones. In well 7120/2-1, the formation is dominated by approximately 10 metre thick fining-upward units of reddish brown coloured conglomerate to siltstone with light grey calcite nodules at the top (Fig 9.20). The pebbles are dominated by variously coloured volcanoclastic material with red- and grey coloured feldspar crystals. The core from 7029/03-U-02 consists of alternating fining-upward coarse pebbly sandstones and reddish brown and greyish green mottled siltstones (Fig 9.23). Sediments are more fine-grained in well 7120/12-4 and they mainly consist of reddish brown to brown mottled sandy siltstones with frequent light grey to greyish green calcareous nodules (Fig 9.22). ","Dating of the formation is difficult because of its lack of fossils. However, a diverse palynomorph assemblage of late Serpukhovian to early Bashkirian age (SO-KV Zone) has been reported recently in well 7120/2-1 in the interval around 2420 m (Lindstr√∂m, in press). The youngest age of the formation is suggested by the basal part of the overlying Falk Formation, dated as late Bashkirian in well 7120/2-1 (Stemmerik et al. 1998). "
Ula Formation,ula formation,FORMATION,vestland group,Norway,"In the type well the Ula Formation is a generally massive, fine to medium grained, grey sandstone. A thin, dark grey siltstone is present in the basal part of the formation. The sandstones are arkosic to subarkosic, glauconitic and micaceous. Sorting and angularity vary between individual units of the formation. Bivalve shells and belemnite debris occur, often concentrated in thin lag deposits. Thin, nodular calcite-cemented bands are common.^Within the Ula Field the Ula Formation can be subdivided into a number of units on the basis of large scale coarsening upward and fining upward cycles (Bailey et al., op. cit.). The sandstones are extensively bioturbated throughout, and this usually obliterates smaller scale sedimentary features. However, in rare zones, parallel or low angle inclined lamination and planar cross bedding are preserved. ","Oxfordian to Ryazanian. In the region of the Ula Field the sands are Oxfordian to Early Volgian in age. Around the fringes of the J√¶ren and Mandal Highs and locally on the Southern Vestland Arch, developments of the formation may be as young as Middle/Late Volgian or possibly Ryazanian. "
Ulv Formation,ulv formation,FORMATION,bjarmeland group,Norway,"Dark fine-grained bioclastic limestones dominate the formation. The dominant microfacies are bryozoan-crinoidal wackestones and more rarely packstones. Additional faunal elements include siliceous sponges, brachiopods and rare fusulinids. The limestone is thinly bedded and often contains thin silt laminae. Shales and silty limestones are locally abundant and chert nodules occur locally. The formation includes thin, less than 15 m, units of coarser grained bioclastic limestone that lithologically resemble the overlying Isbj√∏rn Formation‚Äôs dominant lithologies. ",Fusulinids suggest a mid-Sakmarian to Artinskian age (Davydov 2000). 
Utsira Formation1),utsira formation1),FORMATION,nordland group,United Kingdom,"The formation consists of marine sandstones and claystones. The sandstones are clear to white, often light greenish and normally very fine to fine grained, in places medium to very coarse grained. Occasionally rock fragments and lignite are found. The sandstones are separated by soft, plastic, light greenish claystones and minor siltstones. Glauconite and fossil fragments are common throughout. ",Middle to Late Miocene. 
Vade Formation,vade formation,FORMATION,cromer knoll group,Norway,"The formation is dominated by light to dark grey, olive-grey, greenish and brownish, often calcareous claystones, and passes into light grey, light greenish-grey and light olive-grey marlstones and stringers of limestone. Mica, pyrite and glauconite are common. The claystones may be silty, and siltstones or very fine-grained sandstone layers or laminae are present. Where major sandstone layers occur they are regarded as belonging to the Ran sandstone units.
