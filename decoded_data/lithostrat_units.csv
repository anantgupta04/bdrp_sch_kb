In the reference well, the upper part of the formation consists of medium- and coarse-grained to pebbly sandstones and conglomerates alternating with dark grey claystones. The conglomerates are both matrix- and grain-supported. The claystones are often found as 0.5-5 m thick layers between the sandstones.

BILLEFJORDEN GP,GROUP,,11,,"On the Finnmark Platform, medium- to coarse-grained, occasionally conglomeratic, sandstones and minor siltstones and coals dominate the basal part of the succession represented by the Soldogg Formation. These are overlain by a succession of stacked metre-scale fining-upward cycles of sandstone, siltstone, claystone and coal assigned to the Tettegras Formation. The upper part of the group, represented by the Blærerot Formation, is characterised by a basal unit of fossiliferous limestones, overlain by marine shales and fine- to medium-grained, fluvial and shallow marine sandstones. Sediments tentatively assigned to the group are very differently developed on the Loppa High where well 7120/2-1 penetrated 847 m of varicoloured arkosic breccias, conglomerates, ignimbrites and other types of volcanoclastic deposits (Fig 9.10). The basal 115 m are dominated by brownish siltstone and mudstone. The red nature of these sediments, together with their high content of volcanoclastics, makes them anomalous representatives of the Billefjorden Group in this area, although palynomorphs indicate an early Carboniferous age (Viséan PU to VF Miospore zones from 3467 to 2682 m and early Serpukhovian TK Zone from 2645 to 2630 m) (Lindström, in press). The only other arctic areas where lower Carboniferous red beds have been found are in the northern part of eastern Greenland (Stemmerik et al. 1993), but even there the change to red beds appears to have occurred in the late Tournaisian – i.e. older than the earliest datings on the Loppa High. The Loppa sequence’s overall lithology and tectonic setting seems rather to suggest closer affinities to the lowermost clastics of the overlying mid-Carboniferous Gipsdalen Group. More work is clearly needed on this problem, especially in view of this representing the only occurrence of volcanoclastics in the Upper Palaeozoic of the Barents Shelf; we note that dolerite dykes of probable mid- to late Carboniferous age have been reported by Lippard & Prestvik (1997) on Magerøy in Finnmark and mid-Carboniferous volcanics have also been identified on the adjacent Kola peninsula in northern Russia (Ulmishek 1982). In view of these uncertainties, this sequence has not yet been defined as a formational unit, and its assignment to the Billefjorden Group is still tentative.","The Billefjorden Group has been assigned to the Famennian to Viséan in the onshore areas of Bjørnøya and Spitsbergen (Dallmann et al. 1999; Worsley et al. 2001). The offshore development has been dated to the Viséan to early Serpukhovian. On the Finnmark Platform, palynomorphs suggest that the basal part of the group is of middle to late Viséan age (Bugge et al. 1995), i.e. significantly younger than the Famennian to Tournaisian age recorded for the basal sediments onshore. The upper part of the group is apparently of late Viséan to early Serpukhovian age (Bugge et al. 1995; Simon-Robertson 1992 and Geochem Group 1994). As noted above - the succession on the Loppa High has been dated to the Viséan to early Serpukhovian (Lindström, in press)."
BJARMELAND GP,GROUP,,12,,"The group is dominated by white to light grey bioclastic limestones containing a typical cool-water fauna of crinoids, bryozoans, brachiopods and siliceous sponges. Silty, dark grey to black, locally bituminous limestones characterise the deeper-water succession. Minor cherts occur, especially in the uppermost part. Siliciclastics are rare, except on the Polheim Subplatform where the group is unusually developed and dominated by fine-grained siliciclastics and marls (well 7120/1-1 R2). The Hambergfjellet Formation on Bjørnøya consists of basal sandstones which onlap all older units from basement to Gipsdalen Group, passing up into sandy bioclastic limestones with a fauna dominated by crinoids, bryozoans and brachiopods (Worsley et al. 2001).","Fusulinids suggest a mid-Sakmarian to late Artinskian age in 7128/6-1 (Ehrenberg et al. 2000). The base of the group is thought to be highly diachronous, oldest in the more distal settings and youngest on the platforms (Fig 9.4). The Hambergfjellet Formation on Bjørnøya is dated as late Artinskian based on fusulinids and conodonts (Nakrem 1991; Nakrem et al. 1992). Fusulinids indicate a similar age in cores 7128/12-U-01 and 7129/10-U-01 (Bugge et al. 1995; Ehrenberg et al. 2000)."
BLODØKS FM,FORMATION,SHETLAND GP,13,143.0,"The formation consists of red, green, grey and black shales and mudstones which are non-calcareous to moderately calcareous.

BLÆREROT FM,FORMATION,BILLEFJORDEN GP,14,11.0,"The lowermost five metres of the Blærerot Formation consist of intensely bioturbated grey to yellowish brown limestone and sandy dolomites in core 7029/03-U-01. Bugge et al. (1995) described these as partially dolomitised mudstones and wackestones containing gastropods, brachiopods, bivalves, trilobites, foraminifers and crinoids. Large, laminated irregular nodules, interpreted as oncoids, are present in the lower part. The carbonates are overlain by a 23 m thick coarsening-upward succession of dark grey silty shale with a total organic carbon (TOC) content of 3-4% in the lower part. The shale becomes more bioturbated and less organic-rich upwards. It contains much of the same marine fossils as in the underlying carbonate unit, but in addition abundant terrestrial plant remains are present. There is sharp transition towards the overlying 22 m thick sandstone dominated unit, which consists of two coarsening-upwards cycles with basal dark grey siltstones. The sandstones are fine- to medium-grained and contain low-angle trough cross lamination and wave ripples (Fig 9.17). Yellowish-brown silty shales with some coal abruptly overlie the apparently shallow marine succession of the lower Blærerot Formation and these are interpreted as coastal plain deposits (Fig 9.18). Log correlation suggests that the same overall lithologies are present in the reference well 7128/6-1. Cuttings from the basal carbonate bed in this well include a fauna very similar to that described from the type section.",Palynomorphs in the type section indicate a late Viséan – early Serpukhovian age in the type section (Bugge et al. 1995). A similar age range is indicated for the formation in well 7128/6-1 (Simon-Robertson 1992).

GIPSDALEN GP,GROUP,,51,,"The group is composed of metre-thick to rarely tens of metre-thick rhythmic units generally showing shallowing upward trends continental red bed sandstones, siltstones and conglomerates dominate the basal part of the succession. These are overlain by mixed carbonates and siliciclastics where the siliciclastics are grey-coloured marine sandstones, conglomerates and shales and the carbonates include a variety of shallow marine facies. The upper part of the group is dominated by rhythmically bedded limestones and dolomites with occasional small phylloid algal – Palaeoaplysina buildups, and minor evaporites on the platform areas. The biota is of chlorozoan composition and dominated by algae and foraminifers (c.f. Lees & Buller 1972). Seismic data suggest that the shelf carbonates pass into several hundred metre thick successions of stacked buildups in the deeper ramp areas (Elvebakk et al. 2002). These buildups have not been drilled and their internal composition and exact stratigraphic position is therefore unknown. However, similar relationships are described from age equivalent rocks in the Sverdrup Basin where the largest build-ups occur on the basin slope (Beauchamp 1993).

POLARREV FM,FORMATION,BJARMELAND GP,124,12.0,"The formation consists of a variety of facies that characterise carbonate buildups. The bulk of the formation consists of bryozoan- and bryozoan/Tubiphytes-dominated wackestones and cementstones with abundant early marine cement (Fig 9.44). Wackestones dominate the bioherm encountered in the type well, where a sparse assemblage of fenestrate bryozoans, brachiopods and crinoids formed a loose framework that trapped the carbonate mud. The wackestones also display Stromatactis-like cavities, which form a complex interconnected pore system. The cavities are often partly supported by fenestrate bryozoans and brachiopods, and are often filled by geopetal internal sediments with a grainstone or packstone fabric. The geopetal fabrics indicate that deposition occurred on primary slopes of up to 45o (Blendinger et al. 1997). The limestone is massive to thickly bedded, white to light grey, locally pinkish grey and light brownish grey in colour.

The lavas are grey or purplish, vesicular and often partially altered, and locally completely laterised. Large fresh pyroxene phenocrysts and smaller altered olivine phenocrysts are set in a groundmass of pyroxene and feldspar. Autobrecciation, late hydrothermal activity and deep weathering and oxidation are fairly common. The epiclastics, ranging from agglomerate to tuffs, comprise lava and phenocryst clasts, or primary pumice and ? lapilli fragments. Only minor pyroclastics have been recognised. Interbedded sediments are present towards the base of the type section, consisting of dominantly red to brown mudstone, which is soft to firm and locally calcareous. Minor amounts of red-brown or grey-green siltstone and fine grained, friable, brown sandstone are present. Lateral lithological and petrographical variations have been described by Howitt and others (1975).","Present evidence indicates a Middle Jurassic age (Bajocian–Bathonian). In the southern part of the volcanic province the interbedded red-beds are barren, but sparsely fossiliferous grey beds in the north near the base and top of the formation yield Bajocian–Bathonian dates, based on floral dating and rare ostracods. Radiometric dating of whole-rock samples which are sheared, altered and often with secondary mineralization has provided a range of minimum ages from 165+/- 4 Ma (million years) to 109+/- 2 Ma.

ØRN FM,FORMATION,GIPSDALEN GP,195,51.0,"The formation is dominated by shallow marine carbonates on the platform areas and interbedded carbonates and evaporites in the more distal ramp to basinal settings. The carbonates contain a warm-water biota dominated by small foraminifers, fusulinids and calcareous algae and with abundant fragments of Palaeoaplysina (Fig 9.36a , 9.36b , 9.36c , 9.37). Crinoids, bryozoans, brachiopods and corals are also present. Siliciclastics are rare in the Ørn Formation and the vast bulk of its rhythmic development is characterised by pure carbonates, or more distally, carbonates and evaporites - in contrast to the mixed siliciclastics and carbonates of the underlying Falk Formation. A temporary return to mixed carbonates and shales near the top of the formation is characterised by a gamma ray peak on the logs. In well 7128/6-1, the lower part of the formation consists of rhythms of dolomitic mudstone and bryozoan wackestone with minor thin shales (Fig 9.30 , 9.31 , 9.36a , 9.36b , 9.36c , 9.37). This is followed by a succession of Palaeoaplysina-dominated buildups interbedded with fusulinid-dominated wackestone, overlain by an interval dominated by dolomitic mudstone with abundant anhydrite nodules. The upper part of the formation in this well consists of a thick unit dominated by foraminifer- and algal-rich packstones and grainstones overlain by cyclic deposited shales and crinoid-dominated silty wackestones that gradually pass up into foraminifer-dominated packstones and grainstones.

In addition more than 5 m thick beds of massive to laminated anhydrite occur in 7029/03-U-02 and 7030/03-U-01 and native sulphur is locally present between 20 m and 35 m in 7029/03-U-02. In well 7226/11-1 the lower part of the Ørn Formation consists of light grey to medium dark brownish grey dolomitic mudstones to packstones. These are interbedded with light grey to white massive anhydrite that increases in abundance upward to 4392.5m. Above this level rhythms of dark greyish-green calcareous shale and light grey fossiliferous limestone with chert nodules dominate. This unit is equivalent to the upper part of 7128/6-1.

In core 7030/03-U-01 the base of the formation correlates to the Kasimovian-Gzelian boundary and in 7029/03-U-02 the lower part of the formation is of middle Gzelian age (Stemmerik et al. 1995). The top of the formation is dated as early Sakmarian in core 7129/10-U-02 (Bugge et al. 1995).

This sequence is very difficult to correlate in the Norwegian sector, even over small distances, and is therefore regarded as representing local variations in the lowermost part of the Åsgard Formation. In the Danish sector this sequence is defined as the Leek Member (Jensen et al. 1986).","Where the Tuxen Formation occurs, the Åsgard Formation ranges in age from Late Ryazanian to Late Hauterivian.
