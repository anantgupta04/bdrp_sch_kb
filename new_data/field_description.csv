Ekofisk was discovered in 1969, and the initial plan for development and operation (PDO) was approved in 1972. Test production was initiated in 1971 and ordinary production started in 1972. Production was initially routed to tankships until a concrete storage tank was installed in 1973. Since then, the field has been further developed with many facilities, including facilities for associated fields and export pipelines. Several of the initial facilities have already been removed or are awaiting decommissioning. The initial field development started with three production platforms: Ekofisk A, Ekofisk B and Ekofisk C. Wellhead platform Ekofisk X and process platform Ekofisk J were installed in 1996 and 1998, respectively, as part of the Ekofisk II project. In 2005, wellhead platform Ekofisk M was installed as part of the Ekofisk Growth Project. A plan for water injection at Ekofisk was approved in 1983. Ekofisk K, which is the main injection facility, started water injection in 1987 and is still in operation. There had also been water injection at Ekofisk W from 1989 until 2009, when Ekofisk W was shut down and replaced by a subsea template, Ekofisk VA. A PDO for the development of Ekofisk South was approved in 2011. The project included two new installations in the southern part of the field: production platform Ekofisk Z and a subsea template for water injection, Ekofisk VB. Injection from Ekofisk VB and production from Ekofisk Z started in 2013. The accommodation facilities Ekofisk H and Ekofisk Q were replaced by Ekofisk L in 2014.

The reservoir rock has high porosity, but low permeability. The reservoir has an oil column of more than 300 metres and lies at 3,000 metres depth. ",43506
EKOFISK,Recovery ,"Ekofisk was originally produced by pressure depletion and had an expected recovery factor of 17 per cent. Since then, comprehensive water injection has contributed to a substantial increase in oil recovery. Large-scale water injection started in 1987, and in subsequent years, the area for water injection has been extended in several phases. Experience has proven that water displaces the oil much more effectively than anticipated, and the expected final recovery factor for Ekofisk is now estimated to be over 50 per cent. In addition to the water injection, compaction of the soft chalk provides extra force to drainage of the field. The reservoir compaction has resulted in about 10 metres subsidence of the seabed, especially in the central part of the field. It is expected that the subsidence will continue, but at a much lower rate.",43506

Part of the reservoir is also in the underlying Fensfjord Formation of Middle Jurassic age. The field consists of three relatively large rotated fault blocks. The eastern fault block constitutes Troll Øst. The reservoir depth at Troll Øst is 1,330 metres. Pressure communication between Troll Øst and Troll Vest has been proven. Originally, the oil column in Troll Øst was mapped to be 0-4 metres thick. A well drilled in 2007 proved an oil column of 6-9 metres in the Fensfjord Formation in the northern segment of Troll Øst. The Troll Vest oil province originally had a 22 to 26-metre-thick oil column under a small gas cap, located at a depth of 1,360 metres. The Troll Vest gas province originally had an oil column of 12-14 metres under a gas column of up to 200 metres. The oil column is now reduced to only 2 to 4 metres thickness.

YME,Development ,"Yme is a field in the southeastern part of the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, 130 kilometres northeast of the Ula field. The water depth is 100 metres. The field comprises two separate main structures, Gamma and Beta, which are 12 kilometres apart. Yme was discovered in 1987, and the plan for development and operation (PDO) was approved in 1995. Yme was originally developed with a jack-up drilling and production platform on the Gamma structure and a storage vessel. The Beta structure was developed with a subsea template. Production started in 1996. In 2001, production ceased because operation of the field was no longer regarded as profitable. Yme was the first field on the Norwegian continental shelf to be considered for redevelopment after being shut down. The PDO for a redevelopment was approved in 2007. The development concept was a new mobile offshore production unit (MOPU). Due to structural deficiencies and the vast amount of outstanding work to complete the MOPU, it was decided to remove it from the field in 2013. The MOPU was removed in 2016 in accordance with the authorities&#146 formal disposal resolution. In March 2018, an amended PDO for the redevelopment of Yme was approved. The PDO includes a leased jack-up rig equipped with drilling and production facilities, a subsea template on the Beta structure, and reuse of existing facilities on the field. The plan is to reuse the nine wells pre-drilled in 2009-2010 and to drill seven additional wells.",43807
